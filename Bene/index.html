						<p>Special  Flavor</p>
						<li>
							Some flowers have good aroma and tasty when they are used to make dishes.

						</li>
						<p>Location Advantage</p>
						<li>
							For  the  location  of the  restaurant,  we  are  going  to  choose  the  place  at  the  downtown area in kun ming. The downtown area has many beneficial factors

					<P>
						1. Currently, the flower catering services are not mature in kun ming, there are no certain groups of customers.

						With the  constant  development  of china,s  catering  industry, the turnover  and employment quantity of restaurants are
						raising, china,s restaurants begin to attach importance to brand shaping， focusing on the expansion of business scale using business
						chain  and  franchise o in  china,s  catering  market,  fast  food  is  mainly western-style  food  and  the  dinner  is  mainly
						chinese  food.  Western  food  is gradually booming, but still very small scale. Nowadays, as the income level is increasing,

						For the catering industry, food taste and excellent services are the base, which need excellent administrative staff,

			<h1>Single-Target-Market Strategy</h1>
			<article>
				<p>
				<p>
					At the beginning  stage, we  didn,t run the business before and we are lack  of experiences, therefore, we will have a low market share .
					The restaurant will adopt single-target-market strategies, targeting on the high income customers,
					pay close attention to the market demand of the leisure catering and business conference, providing unique products and services.( Li Huali, Xu Lingzhi.2009)
				</p></br>

				<p><b>Incresing Phase</b></p>
				<p>
					During this period, the sales and profits are increasing rapidly. There will be more rivals.
					we are going to use the following strategies:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Reduced Cost</li>
					<p>
						since  we  have  the  advantages  of the  technical  support  from  the  college  and cooperate with the flower planting base around kun Ming, we could reduce the cost of the raw materials.
					</p>
					<li>Increasing quality of products and services</li>
					<p>
						Gradually increasing products and services, perfecting all the regulations and rules, establishing unique and first-class business culture.
					</p>
					<li>New Distribution Channel</li>
					<p>
						Franchise  to  open  new  branches.  Besides,  it  is  important  to  attract  new investments, make effective control, enhance reputation, and learn experiences during operation
					</p>
					<li>Advertisement Focus</li>
					<p>
						contact with the social media, develop public relationship propaganda,
						making promotion and set up the business stage.
					</p>

				</ul>
				<p><b>Decrease Phase</b></p>
				<p>
					A. Keep maintaining the brand image, reduce some services and gradually quit from the  market.
					Reduce cost and expenditures while the sales are  keeping dropping
				</p>

				<p>
					B. Change the operation model and direction. Switching the main business
					to the flower health care and some new services to reduce the negative effect to the minimum
